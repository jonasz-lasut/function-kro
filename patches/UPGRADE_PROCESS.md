# Function-KRO Upstream Upgrade Process

This document describes the process for upgrading function-kro to a new upstream KRO version. The process is designed to be repeatable and can be executed by humans or AI agents.

## Overview

Function-KRO vendors code from upstream [kubernetes-sigs/kro](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kro) with adaptations for running as a Crossplane composition function. When upstream KRO releases a new version, we need to:

1. Understand what changed upstream
2. Copy the new code
3. Re-apply our adaptations
4. Validate everything works

## Commit Strategy

**Make incremental commits after each major step.** This provides:
- Clear diffs showing exactly what changed at each phase
- Recovery points if something goes wrong
- Easier debugging when tests fail
- Ability to pause and resume the upgrade

The commits can be squashed into a single commit before merging if desired, but keeping them separate during development is essential for tracking progress and debugging.

**Commit points in this process:**
1. After copying upstream files (raw upstream code)
2. After fixing import paths (mechanical transformation)
3. After restoring our additions (preserve our custom files)
4. After applying adaptations (our modifications to upstream code)
5. After documenting changes (patches documentation)
6. Final commit with any remaining cleanup

## Directory Structure

```
patches/
├── UPGRADE_PROCESS.md           # This document
├── v{OLD}_PATCHES.md            # Adaptations we made for the previous version
├── v{OLD}_to_v{NEW}_CHANGES.md  # Analysis of upstream changes (AI-generated)
└── v{NEW}_PATCHES.md            # Adaptations for the new version (created during upgrade)
```

**Example for v0.7.1 → v0.8.0:**
```
patches/
├── UPGRADE_PROCESS.md
├── v0.7.1_PATCHES.md            # What we changed for v0.7.1
├── v0.8.x_UPSTREAM_CHANGES.md   # What upstream changed in v0.8.x
└── v0.8.x_PATCHES.md            # What we changed for v0.8.x (created during upgrade)
```

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Analysis

**Goal:** Understand what changed upstream before touching any code.

### Step 1.1: Review Release Notes

Read the upstream release notes to understand the high-level changes:
```
https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kro/releases/tag/v{NEW}
```

Look for:
- New features (may require new adaptations)
- Breaking changes (will definitely require attention)
- Bug fixes (usually come free)
- Dependency updates (may affect go.mod)

### Step 1.2: Clone Both Versions

```bash
# Clone the old version we're currently based on
git clone --depth 1 --branch v{OLD} \
    https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kro.git /tmp/kro-old

# Clone the new version we're upgrading to
git clone --depth 1 --branch v{NEW} \
    https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kro.git /tmp/kro-new
```

### Step 1.3: Generate Upstream Changes Analysis

Have an AI agent (or manually) analyze the differences and create `v{OLD}_to_v{NEW}_CHANGES.md`:

```bash
# Compare the relevant directories
diff -r /tmp/kro-old/pkg/graph /tmp/kro-new/pkg/graph
diff -r /tmp/kro-old/pkg/cel /tmp/kro-new/pkg/cel
diff -r /tmp/kro-old/pkg/runtime /tmp/kro-new/pkg/runtime
diff -r /tmp/kro-old/pkg/metadata /tmp/kro-new/pkg/metadata
```

**The analysis document should include:**

1. **Executive Summary** - High-level impact assessment
2. **New Features** - What was added and whether function-kro needs it
3. **API Changes** - Constructor signatures, method signatures, type changes
4. **File Changes** - Which files were added/modified/deleted
5. **Dependency Changes** - go.mod differences
6. **Action Items** - Specific things that need adaptation

**AI Agent Prompt for Analysis:**
```
Review the upstream KRO changes between v{OLD} and v{NEW}.

Context:
- Release notes: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kro/releases/tag/v{NEW}
- Comparison: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kro/compare/v{OLD}...v{NEW}

Generate a document covering:
1. Summary of changes with impact assessment for function-kro
2. New types/functions introduced in pkg/graph/, pkg/cel/, pkg/runtime/
3. Changed function signatures (especially constructors)
4. Removed types/functions
5. Dependency version changes

Focus on changes that affect:
- graph.Builder and NewResourceGraphDefinition
- Runtime creation and resource rendering
- CEL environment and expression evaluation
- Schema resolution interfaces
```

---

## Phase 2: Copy New Files

**Goal:** Replace vendored KRO code with the new version.

### Step 2.1: Remove Old Files

```bash
# Remove existing vendored code (but preserve our additions)
rm -rf kro/graph/dag/
rm -rf kro/graph/parser/
rm -rf kro/graph/fieldpath/
rm -rf kro/graph/crd/
rm -rf kro/graph/variable/
rm -rf kro/cel/
rm -rf kro/runtime/
rm -rf kro/metadata/

# Keep these files (our additions):
# - kro/graph/schema/resolver/schema_map_resolver.go
# - kro/graph/schema/resolver/crd_resolver.go
# - kro/graph/schema/resolver/resolver.go (will need merge)
# - kro/graph/schema/schema.go (will need merge)
```

### Step 2.2: Copy New Files

```bash
# Copy from upstream
cp -r /tmp/kro-new/pkg/graph/* kro/graph/
cp -r /tmp/kro-new/pkg/cel/* kro/cel/
cp -r /tmp/kro-new/pkg/runtime/* kro/runtime/
cp -r /tmp/kro-new/pkg/metadata/* kro/metadata/
```

**COMMIT CHECKPOINT 1: Raw upstream code**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore(upgrade): copy upstream KRO v{NEW} files

Raw copy of upstream KRO v{NEW} packages before any modifications.
Import paths still reference upstream github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kro/pkg/.

This commit captures the unmodified upstream state for diff comparison.
EOF
)"
```

This commit establishes a clean baseline of upstream code. All subsequent
commits will show exactly what we modified.

### Step 2.3: Fix Import Paths

Upstream uses `github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kro/pkg/...` but we use `github.com/upbound/function-kro/kro/...`:

```bash
# Update import paths in copied files
find kro/ -name "*.go" -exec sed -i '' \
    's|github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kro/pkg/|github.com/upbound/function-kro/kro/|g' {} \;

# Also update any api/ imports if present
find kro/ -name "*.go" -exec sed -i '' \
    's|github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kro/api/|github.com/upbound/function-kro/input/|g' {} \;
```

**COMMIT CHECKPOINT 2: Import paths fixed**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore(upgrade): fix import paths for function-kro

Mechanical transformation of import paths:
- github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kro/pkg/ → github.com/upbound/function-kro/kro/
- github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kro/api/ → github.com/upbound/function-kro/input/

No functional changes, just import path updates.
EOF
)"
```

This commit isolates the import path changes, making it easy to verify
only the expected substitutions were made.

### Step 2.4: Restore Our Additions

If our addition files were overwritten, restore them from git or re-create:

```bash
git checkout -- kro/graph/schema/resolver/schema_map_resolver.go
git checkout -- kro/graph/schema/resolver/crd_resolver.go
# Note: resolver.go and schema.go may need manual merge
```

**COMMIT CHECKPOINT 3: Our additions restored**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore(upgrade): restore function-kro custom files

Restored files that are unique to function-kro (not from upstream):
- kro/graph/schema/resolver/schema_map_resolver.go
- kro/graph/schema/resolver/crd_resolver.go

These files provide Crossplane-specific schema resolution.
EOF
)"
```

This commit restores our custom files that may have been overwritten
during the copy operation. The codebase likely won't compile yet.

---

## Phase 3: Re-Apply Adaptations

**Goal:** Make the new upstream code work with Crossplane's function model.

### Step 3.1: Identify Compilation Errors

```bash
go build ./...
```

This will show what broke. Common issues:
- Constructor signature mismatches
- Missing/renamed types
- Changed method signatures

### Step 3.2: Apply Adaptations

Using the previous `v{OLD}_PATCHES.md` as a guide, re-apply each adaptation:

**AI Agent Prompt for Adaptations:**
```
I'm upgrading function-kro from KRO v{OLD} to v{NEW}.

Context files:
1. patches/v{OLD}_PATCHES.md - Our previous adaptations and their intent
2. patches/v{OLD}_to_v{NEW}_CHANGES.md - What changed upstream
3. fn.go - Our Crossplane function entry point
4. Current compilation errors from `go build`

Tasks:
1. Re-apply the adaptations from v{OLD}_PATCHES.md to the new code
2. For each adaptation, check if the upstream API changed and adapt accordingly
3. If upstream added new features (like forEach), integrate them
4. Do NOT blindly copy old code - understand the intent and apply appropriately

Key adaptations to re-apply:
- Builder constructor: Accept (resolver, restMapper) instead of (clientConfig, httpClient)
- NewResourceGraphDefinition: Accept (ResourceGraph, *spec.Schema) instead of full RGD CR
- REST mapping fallback when restMapper is nil
- ObjectMeta schema injection in schema resolution paths
- Schema resolution via SchemaMapResolver and CRDSchemaResolver

After fixing compilation, also do the following

- run code generation to update generated methods and CRD schemas:
go generate ./...

- run tests and fix any failures
```

**COMMIT CHECKPOINT 4: Adaptations applied**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore(upgrade): apply function-kro adaptations to v{NEW}

Re-applied adaptations for Crossplane function compatibility:
- Modified Builder constructor to accept resolver instead of clientConfig
- Updated NewResourceGraphDefinition to accept schema parameter
- Added REST mapping fallback for nil restMapper
- Injected ObjectMeta schema in resolution paths
- [Add any new adaptations specific to this version]

Build passes: yes
Tests pass: yes
EOF
)"
```

This is the most important commit - it shows exactly what we changed
from upstream to make it work as a Crossplane function. The diff from
the previous commit reveals all our adaptations clearly.

### Step 3.3: Handle New Features

If upstream added features that function-kro should support (e.g., Collections/forEach):

1. **Update input types** (`input/v1beta1/input.go`) with new fields
2. **Update fn.go** to handle new runtime behaviors
3. **Add tests** for new functionality

### Step 3.4: Document New Adaptations

Create `v{NEW}_PATCHES.md` documenting:
- All adaptations (carried forward + new)
- Any changes to the adaptation approach
- New features and how they're integrated

**COMMIT CHECKPOINT 5: Documentation updated**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs(upgrade): document v{NEW} patches and changes

Added/updated patch documentation:
- patches/v{NEW}_PATCHES.md - All adaptations for this version
- [Any other documentation changes]

This documents what we changed and why for future upgrades.
EOF
)"
```

Documenting the patches in a separate commit keeps the code changes
clean and makes it clear what was modified vs documented.

---

## Phase 4: Validation

**Goal:** Ensure everything works correctly.

### Step 4.1: Build

```bash
go build ./...
```

Must complete with no errors.

### Step 4.2: Run Tests

```bash
go test -v ./...
```

Fix any test failures. Some may be due to:
- Changed test utilities in upstream
- New validation that catches previously-ignored issues
- Changed behavior that tests need to account for

### Step 4.3: Lint

```bash
golangci-lint run
```

Fix any lint issues.

### Step 4.4: Manual Testing

Let the human handle manual testing and validation for now until we have more automation in place for this.

---

## Phase 5: Finalize

### Step 5.1: Update Documentation

- [ ] Update `patches/v{NEW}_PATCHES.md` with final adaptations
- [ ] Archive or update `patches/v{OLD}_to_v{NEW}_CHANGES.md`
- [ ] Update `AGENTS.md` if architecture changed significantly
- [ ] Update `README.md` with new KRO version

### Step 5.2: Update Dependencies

Check if go.mod needs updates based on upstream:

```bash
# Compare go.mod files
diff /tmp/kro-new/go.mod go.mod

# Update dependencies as needed
go get <package>@<version>
go mod tidy
```

### Step 5.3: Final Cleanup Commit (if needed)

If there are any remaining changes after validation (dependency updates,
lint fixes, etc.), commit them:

**COMMIT CHECKPOINT 6: Final cleanup**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore(upgrade): final cleanup for KRO v{NEW} upgrade

- Updated go.mod dependencies to match upstream
- Fixed lint issues
- [Any other cleanup items]
EOF
)"
```

### Step 5.4: Squash for PR (Optional)

If you prefer a clean single-commit history for the PR, you can squash
all upgrade commits:

```bash
# Count how many commits in the upgrade (adjust N as needed)
git rebase -i HEAD~6

# Or create a squashed commit message:
git reset --soft HEAD~6
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore(deps): bump KRO packages to v{NEW}

Upgraded vendored KRO code from v{OLD} to v{NEW}.

Changes:
- Copied upstream KRO v{NEW} packages
- Re-applied function-kro adaptations
- [List any new features integrated]
- [List any notable changes]

See patches/v{NEW}_PATCHES.md for detailed adaptation documentation.
EOF
)"
```

**Note:** Keeping commits separate during review can help reviewers understand
the upgrade process. Squashing is optional and depends on team preference.

## Quick Reference

### Files We Add (not in upstream)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `kro/graph/schema/resolver/schema_map_resolver.go` | Resolve schemas from Crossplane's required_schemas |
| `kro/graph/schema/resolver/crd_resolver.go` | Resolve schemas from CRDs (fallback path) |

### Files We Modify

| File | Adaptation |
|------|------------|
| `kro/graph/builder.go` | Constructor accepts resolver; NewResourceGraphDefinition accepts schema |
| `kro/graph/schema/resolver/resolver.go` | Combined resolver constructors |
| `kro/graph/schema/schema.go` | ObjectMetaSchema, DeepCopySchema |

### Files We Don't Copy

| Upstream Path | Reason |
|---------------|--------|
| `pkg/controller/` | Controller logic not needed |
| `pkg/simpleschema/` | SimpleSchema not used (Crossplane provides schemas) |
| `pkg/dynamiccontroller/` | Dynamic controller not needed |
| `api/` | We have our own input types |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "undefined: SomeType" errors

The type may have been renamed or moved. Check the upstream changes analysis for renames.

### "cannot use X as Y" errors

A type's definition changed. Look at the new definition and update callers.

### Tests fail with "unexpected call"

Mock interfaces may have changed. Update test mocks to match new interfaces.

### Runtime panics

Often caused by nil pointer issues when upstream added new required fields. Check struct initialization.

## Commit Checkpoint Summary

| Checkpoint | After Step | Purpose |
|------------|------------|---------|
| 1 | 2.2 | Raw upstream code - establishes baseline |
| 2 | 2.3 | Import paths fixed - mechanical change only |
| 3 | 2.4 | Our additions restored - custom files back |
| 4 | 3.2 | Adaptations applied - **most important diff** |
| 5 | 3.4 | Documentation updated - patches documented |
| 6 | 5.3 | Final cleanup - deps, lint, etc. |

**Why these checkpoints matter:**
- Checkpoint 4 (adaptations) is the key diff - it shows exactly what we
  changed from upstream to make it work with Crossplane
- If tests fail after adaptations, compare against checkpoint 3 to see
  exactly what broke
- Checkpoints 1-3 are mechanical and should be reviewable at a glance
